## About me

With professional experience as both a Software QA Analyst and a Software Developer, I bring hands-on knowledge of agile methodologies and the software development life cycle. Outside of work, my passion for technology continues to drive me to learn more. I enjoy working on personal projects with Arduino micro controllers and Raspberry Pi computers, which helps me stay enthusiastic about my field and current with emerging technologies.
