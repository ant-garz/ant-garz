# Hello
## About me

Having both tested software as a QA Analyst and developed software as a Full Stack Developer, I am well versed in agile methodologies and the software development life cycle. Outside of work, I am passionate about music, and technologies I have been introduced to as a student of computer science. I enjoy programming as a hobby for various projects using Arduino boards and Raspberry Pi's.
